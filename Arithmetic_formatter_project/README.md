Arithmetic Formatter
Project Overview
The Arithmetic Formatter is a Python function designed to format a list of simple arithmetic problems (addition and subtraction) vertically and side-by-side, just like how primary school students arrange problems to solve them easily. The function can optionally display the answers as well.

This project helps practice string manipulation, error handling, and formatting in Python.

Features
Accepts up to five arithmetic problems at a time.

Supports only addition (+) and subtraction (-) operators.

Validates input for:

Number of problems (max 5).

Operators (only + or - allowed).

Operands (digits only, max 4 digits).

Formats problems vertically and side-by-side with proper alignment.

Optionally displays the answers below the problems.

Returns meaningful error messages for invalid inputs.

Usage
Function Signature:
python
def arithmetic_arranger(problems, show_answers=False):
    # implementation
problems: List of strings, each string an arithmetic problem (e.g., "32 + 698").

show_answers: Optional boolean (default False). If True, the answers are displayed.

Example:
python
print(arithmetic_arranger(["32 + 698", "3801 - 2", "45 + 43", "123 + 49"]))
Output:

text
   32      3801      45      123
+ 698    -    2    + 43    +  49
-----    ------    ----    -----
With answers:

python
print(arithmetic_arranger(["32 + 8", "1 - 3801", "9999 + 9999", "523 - 49"], True))
Output:

text
  32         1      9999      523
+  8    - 3801    + 9999    -  49
----    ------    ------    -----
  40     -3800     19998      474
Error Handling
The function returns specific error messages for:

More than five problems:

text
Error: Too many problems.
Invalid operators (anything other than + or -):

text
Error: Operator must be '+' or '-'.
Operands containing non-digit characters:

text
Error: Numbers must only contain digits.
Operands longer than four digits:

text
Error: Numbers cannot be more than four digits.
How It Works
Input Validation: Checks the number of problems and validates each problemâ€™s format, operator, and operands.

Formatting: Calculates the width needed for each problem based on operand lengths, aligns operands and operators properly.

Answer Calculation: If requested, computes and aligns the answers.

Output: Returns a formatted string with problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.

Getting Started
Clone or download this repository.

Import or copy the arithmetic_arranger function into your Python script.

Call the function with your list of arithmetic problems.
