FreeCodeCamp Python Projects
This repository contains a collection of Python programming exercises and mini-projects completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. These projects are designed to reinforce fundamental programming concepts, algorithms, and practical application development.

Projects Included:
Vigen√®re Cipher:

Description: Implements a classic polyalphabetic substitution cipher for encrypting and decrypting text using a given keyword. Handles both letters and non-alphabetic characters.

Concepts: String manipulation, modular arithmetic, basic cryptography.

Credit Card Validator (Luhn Algorithm):

Description: A utility that validates credit card numbers using the well-known Luhn Algorithm (modulus 10 checksum). It can handle numbers with common separators like hyphens or spaces.

Concepts: Algorithm implementation, string processing, basic validation.

String Case Converter:

Description: Converts strings from PascalCase or camelCase naming conventions to snake_case, a common requirement for Python styling.

Concepts: String iteration, conditional logic, list comprehensions.

Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm:

Description: An implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest distances and paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. Includes features for outputting specific paths or all paths.

Concepts: Graph algorithms, data structures (dictionaries, lists), optimization, graph traversal.

Relevance to ML: While not an ML algorithm itself, graph algorithms like Dijkstra's are vital for feature engineering in graph-based machine learning (e.g., social networks, recommender systems) and path planning in areas like Reinforcement Learning.

Secure Password Generator:

Description: Generates strong, random passwords that adhere to user-defined constraints (length, minimum numbers, special characters, uppercase/lowercase letters). Utilizes Python's secrets module for cryptographic security.

Concepts: Randomness (secure), string manipulation, regular expressions for validation, loops.
