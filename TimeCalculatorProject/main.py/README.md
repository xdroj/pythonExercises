Fantastic! I'm really glad we got that working and you passed all the tests. That's a great accomplishment!

Now, let's get you a clear and informative README.md file for your Time Calculator project. A good README helps others understand what your project is, how to use it, and what it does.

Time Calculator Project
This project implements a Python function that adds a duration time to a given start time, handling various complexities like AM/PM conversion, day rollovers, and optional day-of-the-week tracking.

Project Description
The core of this project is the add_time function, which takes a start time (in 12-hour format), a duration time, and an optional day_of_the_week. It calculates the resulting time, properly adjusting for AM/PM changes, indicating if the result falls on the "next day" or "n days later," and updating the day of the week if provided.

This project was developed as part of the FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python curriculum.

Features
Time Addition: Accurately adds hours and minutes from a duration to a start time.

AM/PM Handling: Correctly converts between 12-hour AM/PM format and 24-hour format for calculations, and back again for display.

Day Rollover: Identifies and indicates when the calculated time falls on the "next day" or "n days later."

Day of the Week Tracking: If a starting day of the week is provided, the function calculates and displays the correct resulting day of the week.

Case-Insensitive Day Input: Accepts the starting day of the week regardless of capitalization (e.g., "monday", "Monday", "MONday" all work).

No External Libraries: Implemented using only built-in Python features, without importing any external modules.

How to Use
To use the add_time function, you can call it with your desired start time and duration. Optionally, you can also provide a day_of_the_week.

Function Signature:
Python

add_time(start, duration, day_of_the_week=None)
start (string): The starting time in 12-hour format (e.g., "3:00 PM", "11:30 AM").

duration (string): The time to add, in "HH:MM" format (e.g., "3:10", "24:05").

day_of_the_week (string, optional): The starting day of the week (e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday"). Case-insensitive.

Example Usage:
Python

from time_calculator import add_time # Assuming your function is in time_calculator.py

print(add_time('3:00 PM', '3:10'))
# Returns: 6:10 PM

print(add_time('11:30 AM', '2:32', 'Monday'))
# Returns: 2:02 PM, Monday

print(add_time('10:10 PM', '3:30'))
# Returns: 1:40 AM (next day)

print(add_time('11:43 PM', '24:20', 'tueSday'))
# Returns: 12:03 AM, Thursday (2 days later)

print(add_time('6:30 PM', '205:12'))
# Returns: 7:42 AM (9 days later)
Installation
No special installation is required beyond a standard Python 3 environment. Simply copy the add_time function into your Python script (.py file).

Running Tests
If you have a testing framework set up (like unittest as used in FreeCodeCamp), you can run the provided tests to ensure the function works as expected across various scenarios.
