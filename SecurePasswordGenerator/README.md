Here's a README file for your Python Secure Password Generator project!

Secure Password Generator
This Python script provides a robust and customizable password generator designed to create strong, random passwords that meet specified complexity requirements. It leverages Python's secrets module for cryptographic strength, making it suitable for generating passwords for sensitive applications.

Features
Customizable Length: Define the total length of the generated password.

Character Type Control: Specify the minimum number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

Cryptographically Secure: Uses secrets.choice for randomness, which is cryptographically stronger than random.choice for security-sensitive applications.

Constraint Validation: Ensures the generated password meets all minimum required character counts before returning.

How It Works
The core logic is encapsulated within the generate_password function:

Character Pools: It defines sets of characters for letters (uppercase and lowercase), digits, and symbols using Python's string module.

Password Generation Loop: It enters a while True loop:

In each iteration, it constructs a password string by randomly selecting characters from a combined pool of all possible characters (letters + digits + symbols) until the desired length is reached.

Constraint Checking: After generating a candidate password, it defines a list of constraints. Each constraint is a tuple containing:

The minimum required count for a specific character type (e.g., nums, uppercase).

A regular expression pattern to match that character type (e.g., r'\d' for digits, r'[A-Z]' for uppercase letters).

It then uses all() in conjunction with re.findall() to check if all specified constraints are met. re.findall(pattern, password) returns a list of all non-overlapping matches, and len() counts them.

If all constraints are satisfied, the loop breaks, and the valid password is returned. Otherwise, it generates a new password and re-checks.

Usage
To generate a password, simply run the Python script from your terminal:

Bash

python your_script_name.py
(Replace your_script_name.py with the actual name of your Python file, e.g., password_generator.py)

generate_password Function Parameters
You can customize the generated password by calling generate_password with specific arguments:

length (int, default: 16): The total length of the password.

nums (int, default: 1): Minimum number of digits required.

special_chars (int, default: 1): Minimum number of special characters required.

uppercase (int, default: 1): Minimum number of uppercase letters required.

lowercase (int, default: 1): Minimum number of lowercase letters required.

Example Calls:

Python

# Generate a default 16-character password with at least 1 of each type
password_1 = generate_password() 
print(password_1)

# Generate a 20-character password with at least 3 numbers and 2 special characters
password_2 = generate_password(length=20, nums=3, special_chars=2)
print(password_2)

# Generate a password with only letters (no nums or special chars)
password_3 = generate_password(length=10, nums=0, special_chars=0)
print(password_3)
Example Output
When you run the script with the default if __name__ == '__main__': block, you might see output similar to this (passwords are random):

Generated password: u2P@bW!X7m$TqJc5
