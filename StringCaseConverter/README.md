String Case Converter: PascalCase/camelCase to snake_case
This small Python project provides a utility function to convert strings from PascalCase (e.g., MyString) or camelCase (e.g., myString) into snake_case (e.g., my_string). This conversion is commonly used in programming for consistent variable, function, and file naming conventions, especially in Python.

Features
Case Conversion: Transforms strings from common "camel" casing styles to snake_case.

Handles Acronyms: Correctly converts acronyms (e.g., HTTPRequest to http_request if the first letter isn't intended to be part of an initial underscore, IAmAPascalCasedString becomes i_am_a_pascal_cased_string).

Concise Implementation: Utilizes a Python list comprehension for an elegant solution.

How It Works
The core logic resides in the convert_to_snake_case function:

convert_to_snake_case(pascal_or_camel_cased_string):

It iterates through each character (char) in the input string.

For every character:

If the char is an uppercase letter (char.isupper()), it prepends an underscore _ and converts the char to lowercase (_ + char.lower()).

If the char is not uppercase (i.e., lowercase or a non-alphabetic character, though this implementation primarily focuses on letters), it keeps the char as is.

These processed characters (and _ prefixes) are collected into a snake_cased_char_list.

Finally, the snake_cased_char_list is joined together into a single string using ''.join().

The strip('_') method is then applied to remove any leading underscore that might have been added if the input string started with an uppercase letter (like in PascalCase).

Files
main.py (or your Python script name): Contains the convert_to_snake_case function and an example usage in main().

Usage
To use the converter, simply run the Python script. The main() function demonstrates how to call convert_to_snake_case with an example string.

Bash

python your_script_name.py
(Replace your_script_name.py with the actual name of your Python file, e.g., case_converter.py)

Example
The provided main function includes an example:

Python

def convert_to_snake_case(pascal_or_camel_cased_string):
    snake_cased_char_list = [
        '_' + char.lower() if char.isupper()
        else char
        for char in pascal_or_camel_cased_string
    ]
    return ''.join(snake_cased_char_list).strip('_')

def main():
    print(convert_to_snake_case('IAmAPascalCasedString'))
    # Example for camelCase:
    # print(convert_to_snake_case('iAmACamelCasedString'))

main()
When you run this script, it will output:

i_am_a_pascal_cased_string
